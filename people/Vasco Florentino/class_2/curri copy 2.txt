tables not in normal form, example taxonomy
partial normalization, missnaming of entities, e.g. localization, instead of tree_individual. Problems with special characters
PAP – continuous value should not be indexed, net to underline keys, lost common name
identified local as external key, and refers that manutenção is dependent on local, which is not true
only two tables, does not solve redundancies on manutenção, tipologia, local, ocupação. Special characters
Tree tables where the primary key is ObjectID
almost correct. except for the spatial join
almost correct, needs to identify primary and foreign keys. The warning is not a reason to create a join
names of tables and attributes do not need to be <between>. Tree fields underlined, meaning a composite primary key. Some attributes still need normalization
almost correct, missing spatial join
almost correct, missing spatial join, missing identifying keys
all correct, well done!
same columns (nome_vulgar) appear in more than one table, missing spatial join
names of tables and attributes do not need to be <between>. Tree fields underlined, meaning a composite primary key. Some attributes still need normalization
too much tables! Needs to attach to the identification of the entities. Lost spatial component (no spatial table). The exercise should not focus on the table (excel, vllokup), but in the schema model
screenshots show normalization, but schema not, failed to do spatial join
missing normalization of occupation, typology, missing spatial join
